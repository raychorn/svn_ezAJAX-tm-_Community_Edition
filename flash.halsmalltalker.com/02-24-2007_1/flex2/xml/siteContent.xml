This site displays some of the many Flash components Ray C. Horn has created over the years.
These selected Flash components are only a few of the many that were created since 1995. Many Flash components were created to be data-driven with specific URLs that are no longer valid or active therefore only those Flash components that did not have such dependencies have been posted to this site.
As you look at the various Flash components that have been posted to this site keep in mind the fact that the best Flash components will leave you with the feeling that they may not have been coded using Flash at-all.
Over the years Flash Development has evolved from very simplistic "animations" that took a lot of time to create into more complex components that can be easily programmed using far less time, in most cases.
The design of this site may be somewhat "eclectic" for some tastes but it appeals to the Author.
This site displays things that are called "Demos". Demos don't necessarily need to be extremely professional-looking. Demos are generally also known as "Prototypes". Prototypes certainly do not need to be all that professional-looking. The value of Prototypes and Demos is that they exist at-all as opposed to whether or not they appear to be professional quality or even highly-polished.
Those who demand "proof" will never be satisfied with however much proof they might get.
Those who believe in good things will get GREAT things.
