It was coded using a proprietary technique that allows for Rapid Development of Flash components that can be quite complex using very little development time.  As you can see this is a very professional looking Flash 8 component.<br><br>The games posted to this site were also created using this same proprietary programming technique.  Programmers and non-programmers alike can use this same proprietary programming technique with little effort and very little training.</p>
